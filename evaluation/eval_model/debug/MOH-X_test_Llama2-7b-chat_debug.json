Here's my analysis of the given sentence:\n\n(a) Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context:\n\n* \"Goya\" refers to the Spanish artist Francisco Goya.\n* \"wanted\" is a verb that indicates a desire or intention.\n* \"to portray\" is a verb that means to depict or represent someone or something in a visual medium, such as art.\n* \"his mistress\" refers to the woman who is the subject of the artist's desire or attention.\n* \"the Duchess of Alba\" refers to a specific noblewoman who was a patron of the arts and a prominent figure in Spanish society during Goya's time.\n\n(b) Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context:\n\n* \"Goya\" has a basic meaning as a proper noun referring to the artist Francisco Goya.\n* \"wanted\" has a basic meaning of desiring or intending something.\n* \"to portray\" has a basic meaning of depicting or representing something.\n* \"mistress\" has a basic meaning of a woman who is the object of a man's romantic or sexual desire.\n* \"Duchess of Alba\" has a basic meaning of a noblewoman who holds the title of Duchess of Alba.\n\n(c) If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it:\n\n* The basic meaning of \"mistress\" is a woman who is the object of a man's romantic or sexual desire. In the context of Goya's relationship with the Duchess of Alba, the meaning of \"mistress\" is not necessarily metaphorical, as it simply refers to the woman who is the subject of the artist's desire.\n* The basic meaning of \"Duchess of Alba\" is a noblewoman who holds the title of Duchess of Alba. In the context of Goya's relationship with the Duchess of Alba, the meaning of \"Duchess of Alba\" is not metaphorical, as it simply refers to the noblewoman's title.\n\n(d) If so, then mark this lexical unit as metaphorical:\n\n* The meaning of \"mistress\" in the context of Goya's relationship with the Duchess of Alba is not metaphorical, as it simply refers to the woman who is the subject of the artist's desire.\n* The meaning of \"Duchess of Alba\" in the context of Goya's relationship with the Duchess of Alba is not metaphorical, as it simply refers to the noblewoman's title.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I would mark the lexical unit \"mistress\" as non-metaphorical, and the lexical unit \"Duchess of Alba\" as non-metaphorical. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Does the sentence contain metaphors?\" is no."

Therefore, the answer is no, neither \"negociate\" nor \"securities\" are metaphors in this sentence."
