    "response": "(a) Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context:\n\n* \"nucleus\" refers to the central part of an atom, a small, dense region containing most of the atom's mass.\n* \"captured\" means to take hold of something or someone, often in a forceful or sudden manner.\n* \"slow-moving neutrons\" are subatomic particles that have a low velocity or energy.\n\n(b) Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context:\n\n* \"nucleus\" has a more basic meaning as the central part of an atom, but it can also refer to a central organization or structure in other contexts.\n* \"captured\" has a more basic meaning of taking hold of something or someone, but it can also be used in a more abstract sense to describe something that has been gained or obtained.\n* \"slow-moving neutrons\" have a more basic meaning as subatomic particles with a low velocity or energy, but they are not commonly used in other contexts.\n\n(c) If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it:\n\n* The contextual meaning of \"nucleus\" in this sentence is different from its more basic meaning as the central part of an atom, as it is used to describe a specific type of atom (slow-moving neutrons). However, the meaning is not necessarily contrasted with the basic meaning, as the term \"nucleus\" is still being used to refer to a central structure or organization.\n* The contextual meaning of \"captured\" in this sentence is different from its more basic meaning of taking hold of something or someone, as it is used to describe the slow-moving neutrons being held or contained within the nucleus. The contextual meaning does contrast with the basic meaning, as the term \"captured\" is being used to describe a unique and specific situation (the containment of slow-moving neutrons within a nucleus).\n* The contextual meaning of \"slow-moving neutrons\" in this sentence is not necessarily contrasted with its more basic meaning as subatomic particles with a low velocity or energy, as the term is still being used to describe a specific type of particle.\n\n(d) If so, then mark this lexical unit as metaphorical:\n\n* The term \"nucleus\" is not marked as metaphorical, as its meaning in this sentence is not necessarily metaphorical or figurative.\n* The term \"captured\" is marked as metaphorical, as its meaning in this sentence is used in a more abstract sense to describe the containment of slow-moving neutrons within a nucleus, which is a unique and specific situation.\n* The term \"slow-moving neutrons\" is not marked as metaphorical, as its meaning in this sentence is not necessarily metaphorical or figurative.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nYes, the sentence contains metaphors: \"captured\" is marked as metaphorical."
