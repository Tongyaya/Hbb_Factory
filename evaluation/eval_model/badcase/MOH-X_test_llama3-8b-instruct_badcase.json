    "response": "Based on the steps provided, I would analyze the sentence as follows:\n\n(a) Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context:\nThe sentence contains the phrase \"downed the heavily armed suspect\". The verb \"downed\" typically means to bring down or knock down something or someone, often in a violent or forceful manner.\n\n(b) Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context:\nIn other contexts, \"downed\" is often used to describe actions such as bringing down a flag, a tree, or a person. However, in this context, the meaning of \"downed\" is more specific and violent, implying that the policeman subdued or overpowered the suspect.\n\n(c) If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it:\nIn this case, the contextual meaning of \"downed\" in the sentence contrasts with its basic meaning in other contexts. In this sentence, \"downed\" does not mean bringing down something or someone in a gentle or non-violent manner, but rather implies a more forceful and aggressive action.\n\n(d) If so, then mark this lexical unit as metaphorical:\nBased on the analysis, I would conclude that the sentence contains a metaphor. The word \"downed\" is used metaphorically to convey a meaning that is different from its basic meaning in other contexts."
