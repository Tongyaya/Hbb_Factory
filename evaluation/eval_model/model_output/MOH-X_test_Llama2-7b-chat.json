However, without additional information or context, it is impossible to determine whether the term \"erased\" is being used metaphorically to convey a different meaning.\n\nIn general, discriminating metaphors involve analyzing the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context, determining whether each unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts, and comparing the contextual meaning to the basic meaning to determine if it is metaphorical. However, the specific steps involved in identifying metaphors can vary depending on the context and the language being used.\n\nIn the case of the sentence \"The Turks erased the Armenians in 1915,\" it is possible that the term \"erased\" is being used metaphorically to refer to the destruction or removal of the Armenian people, but without additional context or information, it is impossible to say for sure."
