    "response": "Based on the steps provided, I will analyze the sentence:\n\n\"a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps\"\n\n(a) Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context:\n- \"a man\" refers to a human being\n- \"whose name\" refers to the person's identity or label\n- \"is permanently stamped\" refers to a permanent mark or impression\n- \"on our maps\" refers to a geographical representation\n\n(b) Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context:\n- \"stamped\" typically means to apply a mark or impression to a surface\n- In this context, \"stamped\" is used to convey a sense of permanence and visibility, rather than the typical physical action of stamping\n\n(c) If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it:\n- The basic meaning of \"stamped\" is a physical action, but in this context, it means a permanent and visible mark on a geographical representation (maps). The contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning, as it is not a physical action but rather a figurative representation.\n\n(d) If so, then mark this lexical unit as metaphorical:\nYES, the word \"stamped\" is used metaphorically in this sentence."

    "response": "Based on the steps provided, I would analyze the sentence as follows:\n\n(a) Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context:\n\t* \"sales tax\" refers to a type of tax on goods and services\n\t* \"absorbed\" typically means to take something in or incorporate it into something else\n\t* \"state income tax\" refers to a type of tax on income earned within a state\n\n(b) Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context:\n\t* \"absorbed\" has a more basic meaning in other contexts, such as being taken in or incorporated into something (e.g. \"The medicine was absorbed by the body\").\n\n(c) If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it:\n\t* In this case, the basic meaning of \"absorbed\" is being taken in or incorporated into something, whereas in the given context, it means to be combined or merged with something else (state income tax). The contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning, as it's not about taking something in, but rather about combining two taxes.\n\n(d) If so, then mark this lexical unit as metaphorical:\n\t* YES, the lexical unit \"absorbed\" is metaphorical in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: YES, the sentence contains a metaphor."
