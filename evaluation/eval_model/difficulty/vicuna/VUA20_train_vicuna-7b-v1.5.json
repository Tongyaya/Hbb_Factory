      "Yes, the sentence \"Yes yeah erm no there 's little point just now, go on then she 's thought of something else\" contains metaphors.\n\nStep (a) shows that the lexical units in the sentence have meanings in other contexts than in the given discourse context. For example, \"point\" has a basic meaning of a location where something is aimed or intended, and \"go on\" has a basic meaning of continue or proceed.\n\nStep (b) shows that some of these lexical units have more basic meanings in other contexts than in the current context. For example, \"point\" has a more basic meaning of a location where something is aimed or intended, and \"go on\" has a more basic meaning of continue or proceed.\n\nStep (c) shows that the contextual meanings of these lexical units contrast with their basic meanings, and can be understood in comparison with them. For example, the phrase \"little point\" has a contextual meaning of a minor or insignificant matter, which contrasts with the basic meaning of a location where something is aimed or intended. Similarly, \"go on then\" has a contextual meaning of continue or proceed, which contrasts with the basic meaning of continue or proceed.\n\nStep (d) shows that these lexical units are metaphorical because their contextual meanings contrast with their basic meanings and can be understood in comparison with them. Therefore, the sentence \"Yes yeah erm no there 's little point just now, go on then she 's thought of something else\" contains metaphors.",
      "Yes, the sentences contain metaphors.\n\nStep (a): Analyze and determine the meaning of each lexical unit in the discourse context.\n\n* \"little point\" - This phrase has a basic meaning of \"no point\" or \"not worth mentioning,\" but in the given context, it seems to convey a lack of urgency or importance.\n* \"go on then\" - This phrase has a basic meaning of \"please continue,\" but in the given context, it seems to convey a sense of annoyance or impatience.\n* \"she's thought of something else\" - This phrase has a basic meaning of \"she has come up with another idea,\" but in the given context, it seems to convey a sense of distraction or lack of focus.\n\nStep (b): Determine whether each lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the given discourse context.\n\n* \"little point\" - Yes, the phrase has a more basic meaning of \"no point\" or \"not worth mentioning\" in other contexts.\n* \"go on then\" - Yes, the phrase has a more basic meaning of \"please continue\" in other contexts.\n* \"she's thought of something else\" - Yes, the phrase has a more basic meaning of \"she has come up with another idea\" in other contexts.\n\nStep (c): If the lexical unit has a more basic meaning in other contexts than in the current context, determine whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning and can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it.\n\n* \"little point\" - Yes, the contextual meaning (\"little point\") contrasts with the basic meaning (\"no point\" or \"not worth mentioning\"), and we can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it.\n* \"go on then\" - Yes, the contextual meaning (\"go on then\") contrasts with the basic meaning (\"please continue\"), and we can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it.\n* \"she's thought of something else\" - Yes, the contextual meaning (\"she's thought of something else\") contrasts with the basic meaning (\"she has come up with another idea\"), and we can understand the contextual meaning in comparison with it.\n\nStep (d): If so, then mark this lexical unit as metap",
      "Yes, the sentences contain metaphors.",
      "Yes, the sentences contain metaphors.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The first sentence contains a metaphor: \"little point\" means that there is no significant reason to continue the conversation, but the speaker is continuing anyway.\n* The second sentence contains a metaphor: \"thought of something else\" means that the speaker has come up with a new idea or topic to discuss.",
      "Yes, the sentence \"There's little point just now, go on then she's thought of something else\" contains a metaphor.",
      "Yes, the first sentence contains a metaphor. The phrase \"little point\" is a metaphor for the idea that there is no sense in continuing the conversation at the moment. The metaphorical use of \"point\" here contrasts with its more basic meaning of a small mark or dot, which is used to indicate a location or a specific point in time.",

      "Yes, the sentences contain metaphors.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(a) Analyzing the first sentence, \"there's little point just now,\" the lexical unit \"point\" has a more basic meaning of a small area or dot, and its contextual meaning in this sentence is to indicate that there is no sense or purpose in the current situation. This contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning of \"point,\" making it a metaphorical use of the word.\n\n(b) In the second sentence, \"she's thought of something else,\" the lexical unit \"thought\" has a more basic meaning of the process of considering or reflecting on something. Its contextual meaning in this sentence is to indicate that the person has considered or reflected on something else, which contrasts with the basic meaning of \"thought.\"\n\n(c) The contextual meanings of both \"point\" and \"thought\" in their respective sentences contrast with their basic meanings, making them metaphorical uses of these words.\n\n(d) Therefore, we can mark both \"point\" and \"thought\" as metaphorical in these sentences."
